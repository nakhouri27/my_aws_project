Grafana open source software enables you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics, logs, and traces wherever they are stored. Grafana OSS provides
 you with tools to turn your time-series database (TSDB) data into insightful graphs and visualizations.

After you have installed Grafana and set up your first dashboard using instructions in Getting started with Grafana, 
you will have many options to choose from depending on your requirements. For example, if you want to view weather data and statistics about your smart home, 
then you can create a playlist. If you are the administrator for an enterprise and are managing Grafana for multiple teams, then you can set up provisioning and 
authentication.

The following sections provide an overview of Grafana features and links to product documentation to help you learn more.
